Building and Installing with Make
---------------------------------

To build section, type:

    make

You can use section from the directory you built it, no installation
required.

To test the just built section program, type:

    make check

If you want to install it to your system, type:

    make install

To change the default install location of /usr/local to /usr, type:

    make PREFIX=/usr install

You have to keep track of the installed files yourself, if you want to
remove them later on.

Installing section to your system may require administrative ("root")
access.


Additional Makefile Targets
---------------------------

- clean:          remove generated files except archives
- distclean:      remove all generated files
- tar:            create a gzip compressed tar-ball of the sources for
                  distribution
- section.1.html: create HTML version of manual page


Building and Installing with the Go Tool
----------------------------------------

Before using the Go Tool, you should consider the privacy implications.

Starting with some version, the Go Tool communicates with the Google
module proxy and checksum database.  In 2023, there are plans to add
telemetry to the Go Tool with the intent to collect usage data and
transmit it to Google servers and store it there.  Setting some bespoke
environment variables to specific values is supposed to deactivate
all this.

The Go tool for managing Go source code is intended as a Go specific
replacement for Make, and it provides quite a bit of additional
functionality.  If you have set up your system correctly for the Go tool,
and saved the section sources in an appropriate place for the Go tool
to find them, you can use the Go tool to build and/or install section.

To build section, type:

    go build section

To install section, type:

    go install section
