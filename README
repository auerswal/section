This is an implementation of a "section" filter in Go.

The section filter can be used to extract an indented section of text
starting with a line that matches a regular expression.  The matching
line(s) and any indented section under the matching line are printed.

This can be helpful when working with, e.g., Python code, YAML data,
or Free Range Routing (FRR) configuration files.

Use "section --help" for basic usage information and option description.
