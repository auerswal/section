This is an implementation of the "section" filter in Go.

The section filter can be used to extract indented sections of text
based on lines that match a regular expression.

By default, the matching lines and any indented sections under the
matching lines are printed.  Using options, the section start can be
changed to be at an earlier line than the pattern match.

This can be helpful when working with, e.g., Python code, Makefiles,
or Free Range Routing (FRR) configuration files.

Use "section --help" for basic usage information and option description.

At the section homepage[1], you can read an HTML version of the section
manual page[2].

The section filter does not attempt to handle indentation with mixed
space and tab characters.  You can use the widely available expand[3] and
unexpand[4] filters to ensure uniform indentation for use with section.
